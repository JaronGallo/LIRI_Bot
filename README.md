This is a node app that uses APIs from Twitter, Spotify, and a Movie API. You just need to put your API secrets in the code and then you can use the commands to give out the information you are looking for. Use the command 'my-tweets' to grab your latest tweets, "spotify-this-song 'Hello There'" to get data with that song title, and "movie-this 'Star Wars'" to get data with that movie title
